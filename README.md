I create businesses that create businesses and open source packages that aim to make more money than their sources.  I work with Artificial Intelligence (with a custom calculus), and advertising. I aim to make money for my users to provide an incentive to use. I seek to dissolve linguistic boundaries and to construct new ideas. I want people to have what they have now but to be able to sell their services rather than just do it for free.

These are all untapped markets which leads to a creation of value where there was none. Attention is still competed for, but the source of income is challeneged. Without what we've provided their would be no incentive to like something.

### My Portfolio ðŸŒ±

I write regular posts, on Reddit which get funneled into my website which gets funneled into my books.

I create information that creates information, which as a goal in itself leads to nothing but cancer, but for it's application in a specific counter party it means that you can grow power from base principles, mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, psychology, sociology.
